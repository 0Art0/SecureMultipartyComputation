    "The standard definition today formalises security in the following general way. As a mental experiment, consider an ‚Äúideal world‚Äù in which an external trusted (and incorruptible) party is willing to help the parties carry out their computation. In such a world, the parties can simply send their inputs to the trusted party, who then computes the desired function and passes each party its prescribed output. Since the only action carried\n",
    "out by a party is that of sending its input to the trusted party, the only freedom given to an adversary is in choosing the corrupted (the parties under the control of the adversary are called corrupted, and follow the adversary‚Äôs instructions) parties‚Äô inputs."

This formulation of security is called the **ideal/real simulation paradigm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to motivate the usefulness of this definition, we describe why properties like **privacy** (no party should learn anything more than its prescribed output) and **correctness** (each party is guaranteed that the output that it receives is correct) are implied. Privacy follows from the fact that the adversary‚Äôs output is the same in the real and ideal executions. Since the adversary learns nothing beyond the corrupted party‚Äôs outputs in an ideal execution, the same must be true for a real execution. Correctness follows from the fact that the honest parties‚Äô outputs are the same in the real and ideal executions, and from the fact that in an ideal execution, the honest parties all receive correct outputs as computed by the trusted party."
